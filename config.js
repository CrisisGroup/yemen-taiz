But wrangling over a deal to reopen Huthi-controlled roads in and around the city of Taiz – and Huthi demands for salary payments as an inducement to continue the détente - has pushed the truce to the verge of collapse. If an agreement is not struck the conflict may return to, or even exceed, previous levels of destructive intensity, and the prospects of a negotiated settlement will become more distant.</p><a id="freeExplore" href="#INTRO"> BEGIN &nbsp;&nbsp; &#8595; </a><p id="vidcredit">Video: © <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/en-us/news/stories/2022/3/6242bef84/south-sudanese-battle-record-floods-amid-rapidly-changing-climate.html" target="_blank">UNHCR</a></p>',
